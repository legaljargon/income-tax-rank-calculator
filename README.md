# income-tax-rank-calculator
Find out your income tax rank (India) for FY 2017-2018 and AY 2018-2019 (Assessment Year is the year following the Financial Year). <br>
I am learning JS - this is my first project.<br>
The Income Tax Department of India releases statistics on taxpayers who have filed returns. You can check it here. https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/Documents/Direct%20Tax%20Data/IT-Return-Statistics-Assessment-Year-2018-19.pdf <br>
Using this data, I wrote a simple input-output function. <br>
The function checks your gross income in rupees (ie your income pre tax), and compares it to the categories of tax-payers with similar gross income. It then tells you how many people are in the same gross income category as yours. It also tells you what rank you could be among all the individual tax-payers who have filed returns in India that year. <br>
I have made an arithmetic error in calculating the rank, I will fix this shortly. The overall rankings don't add up to the overall number of individuals who filed returns that year. (There is a difference of 23).<br>
Feedback welcome.<br>
